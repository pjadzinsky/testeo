"""
bittrex.client returns balances as a list of dictionaries with:
 Currency, Available, Balance, CryptoAddress, Pending, Requested, Uuid

A portfolio is the type and amount of each cryptocurrency held along with some basic operations.
.
There is a desired 'state' and due to fluctuations some currencies will have more (or less) total_value than their
desired target 'state'. We'll rebalance them periodically.
To avoid spending too much in commissions when rebalancing we have a 'threshold' and we only 'rebalance
cryptocurrencies that increased (or decreased) more than 'threshold' (as a percentage) from desired 'state'.
For example is the desired state is 100 and the threshold is 0.1 we'll sell only if the current total_value is at or above
110 (and buy if the current total_value is at or below 90)
To prevent from buying too much of a sinking currency we are going to put bounds on either the price and/or the
quantities (not clear yet). One idea is to compute the ratio between the current balance and the initial balance
per currency and then say that no currency can have a ratio that is N times bigger than the average ratio.
